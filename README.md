# Food-Recipe-App-Using-ReactJS

Here in this app we should have a component where we are going to show our food recipes. And we need to fetch all the required food recipes using a food recipe API. We will fetch the API data, store those data in a component structure using react hooks (useEffect, useState ). First we need to signup and then go to the APIs section in the navbar.

steps: Click start now in the Developer section. Then go the Dashboard section(top right)>click Application>in the left side Thereâ€™s a Recipe Search API option > click view on that section From there copy your Application ID and Application Keys and store it somewhere

STEPS: Step 1: Create a React application using the following command: npx create-react-app foldername Step 2: After creating your project folder i.e. foldername, move to it using the following command: cd foldername Step 3: Now inside src/App.js file, provide tour own app id and app key in the place of <YOUR_APP_ID> and <YOUR_APP_KEY> which you have got from EDAMAM.
